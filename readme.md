This project is using Atmega8 as the brain of the circuit.
To set this up in your environment, you need Atmega8a 
which is configured to be clocked with 16MHz crystal.
Of course, you can use another atmega uC but some changes
in the soft will be necessary.

This project has been deployed under MIT license.
In case of using my project as a soldering station or whatever you accept the below,
that NO RESPONSIBILITIES:
for damaged appliances such as
transistors, power supplies and so on or injuries 
such as electrocute, burns and so on will be taken.

You can use this project free of charge 
ON YOUR OWN RESPONSIBILITY.

Charts of temperature done after tests will be available soon in this repo.
